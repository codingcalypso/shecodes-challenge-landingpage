              <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The name Oklahoma is taken from Choctaw Indian language that means "red
      people". It is derived from "okla" which means people, and "humma" which
      means red. The history of Oklahoma has a dark beginning with this land
      being the home of many Native American tribes, many of whom were forcibly
      relocated to Oklahoma. This was originally supposed to be considered
      "Indian Territory" in the 1800's, but ranchers from Texas pushed into the
      land in search of new farming settlements, taking land away from Native
      Americans. They did so illegally, as the lands were not open for
      settlement. These individuals crossed the border "sooner" than they were
      allowed to, thus starting the nickname of Oklahoma as the "Sooner" State.
      Oklahoma officially became a state in 1907.

      While the Native American population was forced into decline, Oklahoma
      still has third largest Native American population in the United States
      and 40% of the state is still categorized as Native American land. There
      is no way to describe Oklahoma without mentioning the importance and
      legacy Native Americans have on our state.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the century, Oklahoma has made a name for itself through oil
      and natural gas and has allowed the state to thrive economically. The
      state has now grown to a population just shy of 4 million, and has grown
      the 2 major cities of Oklahoma City and Tulsa into popular travel cities.
